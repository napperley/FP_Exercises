# FP Exercises

Contains functional programming exercises written in Kotlin. All exercises are based on the Python ones in an article 
called, [A practical introduction to functional programming](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming) 
, written by Mary Rose Cook. If you know Python then you can see that Kotlin makes it significantly easier to do 
functional programming. Python's approach to functional programming is odd and very limiting (eg a **lambda** can only 
contain a single line of code in a block, and common higher order functions aren't implicitly imported).
